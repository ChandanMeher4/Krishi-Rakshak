## 1. So, What Is This All About?  
Hey there! Welcome to Krishi Rakshak, our solution for SIH Problem Statement 25099. We’re Team Code Green, and we’re building a smart platform to help farmers tackle one of their biggest headaches: plant diseases.  

This isn't just a basic app—it's a complete AI-powered system that helps with everything from monitoring your crops to helping them recover from a bad spell. Our goal is to give farmers the insights they need, right when they need them, to make their farms healthier and more productive.

## 2. A Quick Tour of the Website  
We've designed our platform to be super easy to use. Here's what you'll find as you click through:  

- **Home Page**: This is where it all starts. It gives a quick overview of what Krishi Rakshak is all about and how we’re here to help.  
- **Authentication Page**: Your personal gateway! Here, you can log in or create an account to get a personalized experience and keep your farm data safe.  
- **Weather Page**: We use the OpenWeather API to give you real-time weather info for your exact location. We also suggest the best actions for your crops based on the forecast, so you can always be prepared.  
- **Dashboard**: This is your command center. It’s a personalized space with all your key info, updates, and records in one place.  
- **The AI Powerhouse**: This is the heart of Krishi Rakshak.  
  - **Live Sensor Data**: Check in on your soil in real time.  
  - **NDVI Crop Health Map**: Think of this as a thermal map for your plants. It uses satellite or drone imagery to show you where your crops are thriving and where they might need a little extra love.  
  - **Plant Disease Detection**: Just snap a pic of a plant part! Our AI instantly analyzes it to tell you if it’s healthy, what the problem is, and how to fix it. It's like having a plant doctor in your pocket.  
- **Contact Page**: Got a question or just want to chat? You can find all our contact info here. We're always happy to help!

## 5. Methodology  
Our approach is divided into the following key phases:  

1. **Data Collection & Monitoring**: Deploy a network of IoT devices to collect continuous data on crop health and environmental conditions. This data is stored and managed in a centralized, cloud-based platform.  
2. **AI/ML Model Development**: Train machine learning models on labeled datasets to develop advanced algorithms for disease detection and progression prediction.  
3. **Prevention & Avoidance Strategy Design**: Develop AI-driven protocols for applying preventive measures, creating a decision-support system that advises farmers on optimal crop management practices.  
4. **Recovery Strategy Development**: Use AI to analyze plant recovery patterns and recommend interventions that promote healing and restore productivity.  
5. **Field Trials & Validation**: Conduct trials in various agricultural settings to assess the system's performance in real-world conditions and gather feedback for refinement.

## 6. Real-World Talk: Feasibility and Challenges  
**Can This Actually Work?**
Absolutely. We're using tried-and-true technology that's both realistic and practical for farms of all sizes.

**What Are the Roadblocks?**
The initial setup cost might be a bit high for some farmers, and getting everyone on board with new tech can be tough. But we're ready for that! We'll look for grants and offer plenty of hands-on support and simple guides to help everyone get started.
